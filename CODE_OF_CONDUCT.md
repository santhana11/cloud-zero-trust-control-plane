# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project is a production-oriented reference implementation for enterprise Zero Trust security. We are committed to maintaining a professional environment where contributors collaborate on technical merit, respect one another, and uphold the security and governance standards of the project.

## Expected Behavior

- Communicate in a clear, professional, and technically accurate manner.
- Focus on the work: architecture, code, policy, and documentation. Critique ideas and implementations, not people.
- Respect differing experience levels, backgrounds, and viewpoints. Assume good faith.
- When disagreeing, base arguments on evidence, design principles, or project goals rather than personal preference alone.
- Honor the security and compliance focus of the project: do not propose or merge changes that weaken controls without explicit justification and documentation.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information (e.g. email, identity) without permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered unprofessional or hostile in a workplace or open-source security project.

## Enforcement Responsibility

Maintainers of this project are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or temporarily or permanently ban a contributor for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Reports may be directed to the maintainers (see MAINTAINERS.md). We will treat reports with discretion and will respond in a way we consider appropriate to the circumstances. We are committed to a fair process and to maintaining a professional and inclusive project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, and other official communication channels). It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public (e.g. conference talks, social media). Representation may be further defined by the maintainers.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is informed by the Contributor Covenant and adapted for a security-focused, enterprise open-source project. It is not legal advice and does not replace the Apache 2.0 license or project-specific governance (e.g. CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md).
